# Label Noise

This repository contains some simulations of the label noise in the case of supervised classification. 
We use two datasets : Iris and Titanic. 
Here are the models that were used:

* DecisionTreeClassifier
* RandomForsetClassifier
* KNeighborsClassifier
* GaussianNB
* SVM
* Neural Network

Two types of noise are distinguished : Feature Noise and Class Noise. In general, Class Noise is more harmful than Feature Noise. In the notebook we compare between these two types of noise for several models. For more information about Label Noise please read this paper :
